ncp \[en] copy files with progress

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]ncp\f[R] is meant to be a safe replacement for standard issue
cp.\ By default it will give you a fancy progress bar keeping track of
the current file copying.
For singular file copying it will check available space before
attempting to copy a file.
In safe mode this safety measure will apply to copying folders as well.
If the folder has a lot of files, this will slow down the initial
copying process as we calculate the folder size.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\f[B]-f\f[R], \f[B]\[en]force\f[R]
Force the copy to take place if the target files already exist,
overwriting as necessary.
.TP
\f[B]-s\f[R], \f[B]\[en]safe\f[R]
When copying directories check to make sure there is sufficient space in
the target directory before starting to copy.
.TP
\f[B]-v\f[R], \f[B]\[en]verbose\f[R]
Cause \f[B]ncp\f[R] to be verbose.
showing files as they are copied.
.TP
\f[B]-q\f[R], \f[B]\[en]quiet\f[R]
Cause \f[B]ncp\f[R] to be quiet.
No progress bars will be shown during the copying process.

make sure there is sufficient free space available to copy the contents
of \f[B]folder_one\f[R].
