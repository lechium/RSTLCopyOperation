// Disclaimer: This implementation is mostly just a tinker toy.
// Copyfile is theoretically the replacement for the FS API that let you do copy operations and get progress callbacks,
// (https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Carbon/Reference/File_Manager/DeprecationAppendix/AppendixADeprecatedAPI.html#//apple_ref/c/func/FSCopyObjectAsync)
// but it still has this in the header:

/*
 * this is an API to faciliatate copying of files and their
 * associated metadata.  There are several open source projects that
 * need modifications to support preserving extended attributes and
 * acls and this API collapses several hundred lines of modifications
 * into one or two calls.
 *
 * This implementation is incomplete and the interface may change in a 
 * future release.
 */

// and personally I think that any API with that in the header
// I wouldn't use in any real software.
